# This is a parameter file that lists the location, and images to process
# for the synthetic blurring of images to generate training data for a 
# Convolutional NN.  The format is as follows:
# <directory where the data is located>,<The infocus image>,<The ground truth image>,<sigma value>
#
# Comments in this file should start with '#'
# The synthetic output will be the same name as the input file with a 'b' appened to
# the end of the file and saved as a .png file and placed in the same directory as the
# source files.
