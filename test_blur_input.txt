# This is a parameter file that lists the location, and images to process
# for the synthetic blurring of images.  The data is arranged as follows: 
#
# data_directory
# the_in-focus_image, ground_truth_image, min_sigma, sigma_step, num_classes
#
# Comments in this file should start with '#'
# The synthetic output will be the same name as the input file with a the 
# min_sigma, sigma_step and num_classes appended to the end of the file and  
# saved as a .png file and placed in the same directory as the 
# the_in-focus_image.
